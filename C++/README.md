Once you have generated the executable, just run
```
./MCMC.x <simulation_directory>
```
where the simulation directory must contain the reference a file input.dat with:
- the path to the reference id
- the random number used to store the network
- the parameters related to the different actions

If this routine is run within the SMCABC_c++.py, the python code will take care of everything
